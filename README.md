git clone <repository-url>
    cd captcha-solver-002
    ```

2.  **Setup and Run:**
    *   If this is a client-side only application (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), simply open `index.html` in your preferred web browser.
    *   If a local server is required (e.g., Node.js, Python, etc., for backend processing or API integration), navigate to the project directory and execute the appropriate start command (e.g., `npm start`, `python app.py`). Refer to the project's internal documentation or scripts for specific instructions on dependency installation and server startup.

3.  **Using the Dark Mode Toggle:**
    Once the application is running, locate the "Theme" or "Dark Mode" button, typically found in the header or sidebar. Click this button to effortlessly switch between the light and dark themes. Your preference will be applied immediately.

4.  **Captcha Solving Functionality:**
    All core captcha solving features from the previous version remain fully accessible and functional. Interact with the captcha interface as you normally would to solve captchas.
